 @brief whether it can respond to a given native method call
 @discussion Native method call usually sends in a form ==> ClassName-methodCallName <==
 The method call name is directly responded by the class via the invocation of [self perfromSelector].
 Implementations should first ask parent instance (super) whether super can respond, and hands over when super cannot.
 @param nativeMethodCall NativeMethodCall the native method call for the inquiry of ability to respond.
 @return returns YES if the native method call can be handled and NO if it cannot be handled

 @discussion prior to the invocation of this method, [inst canRespondToMethodCall:] must be invoked in order to check the availability of the responses
