<p>Xenonscript is a introductory programming language. This repository is used for storing project files. You could visit <a href="http://xenonscript.com/">http://xenonscript.com/</a> if interested.</p>

<p>The Xenonscript Project is a Xcode project, written in Objective-C. The intent of the project is to create a fully qualified programming language on iOS, which conforms to most designing principles by default. The goal of the project is to implement a fully qualified IDE that can perform the following tasks:</p>

<h4>
<a id="1-write-the-program-in-a-gui-window-in-instead-of-in-a-textedit-window" class="anchor" href="#1-write-the-program-in-a-gui-window-in-instead-of-in-a-textedit-window" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>1. Write the program in a GUI window in instead of in a TextEdit window.</h4>

<p>As intended for beginnner, also considering the ease of use, a Xenonscript program can be written in a fully non-textediting window.</p>

<h4>

The program is runnable natively on iOS, without uploading or downloading to a remote server.</h4>

<p>Unlike such program as JVM, it has a built-in runtime support library that supports the program to run natively on iOS.</p>

<h4>

3. Built-in source control functionality, and built-in GitHub support.
</h4>

<p>We believe source control is one of the most important thing during a software's development lifetime. We've used GitHub API to implement source control functionality.</p>

<h4>
<a id="4-built-in-debug-functionality-such-as-breakpoints-debugger-panel-and-run-time-debugging" class="anchor" href="#4-built-in-debug-functionality-such-as-breakpoints-debugger-panel-and-run-time-debugging" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
4. Built-in debug functionality such as breakpoints, debugger panel and run-time debugging.
</h4>

<p>As for introductory programming language, it is important for programming freshman to be aware of the execution process. This debug and debug flowcontrol is currently lacking on all iOS development IDEs.</p>

<h4>
<a id="5-internationalization-and-adaptibility" class="anchor" href="#5-internationalization-and-adaptibility" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
5. Internationalization and adaptibility.
</h4>

<p>As is often the case, people get used to the naming conventions of one programming language and may find it difficult to adapt to another. Additionally, when people's mother tongue is not English, the process of learning to program is more frustrating. Thus, intended to solve these problems, Xenonscript had a built-in support for API localization, and the final program can be written in any localized language besides English.</p>
